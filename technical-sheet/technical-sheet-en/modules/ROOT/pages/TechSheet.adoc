== Overview

Kobee is a cross-platform web-based solution for Application Lifecycle Management. It combines DevOps initiatives (continuous build and continuous integration) and lifecycle management to support the complexity of service-oriented architectures and highly distributed systems.

Kobee encompasses all aspects of the Application Lifecycle Management process offering build management, continuous integration, rebuild, manual build, release management, approval processes and deployment management. Within Kobee, you define, implement and enforce software lifecycle processes, appropriate for your organization, including development, test, quality assurance and final production.

Kobee is a *methodology-independent* and *repository-neutral* tool (enabling cross-platform development). Kobee complies with industry standards, such as CMMI, ITIL and PRINCE. It helps your organization to enforce, control, audit, report and facilitate best practices and guidelines for Application Lifecycle Management, and provides benefits which guarantee conformity with audit requirements and improve communications with the different parties across the IT system.

== Technical Features

=== Build Features

* Support for multiple projects
* Continuous Integration: temporal scheduling of project builds
* Ability to manually initiate a build
* Build/rebuild any project version
* Build/rebuild on multiple environments
* Customizable build workflow: adapt the flow of sub-processes (Phases) to be executed for a build
* Dynamic and secured build parameters which may be edited just before the execution of the build
* Configurable VCR tagging: template-based tagging, defined for each Project Stream (with variables such as project name, build number, date/time, branch prefix, suffix, ...). The default (template-based) tagging may also be overwritten at build creation, e.g., to enable applying labels like "`RC1`" or "`BaseLine4.0`"
* Project dependency:
** include the latest result, a specific result or the production build result of a dependent project
** include and build the latest source or a specific production source version of a dependent project
* Incremental build:
** only build the modified sources compared to the previous build
** only build the modified sources compared to the build in production
** only build the modified sources compared to a specific VCR tag
* Tag-based build: Build based on a specific tag instead of on the latest code

=== Minimum Hardware Requirements

Kobee consists of 4 major components:

* Kobee Web Application
* Kobee Server
* Kobee Agent
* Kobee Commandline

The Kobee Server and Web Application need to be installed on the same host. The Kobee Agent and Commandline can be installed on remote hosts.

==== Kobee Web Application

* RAM: minimum 512 MB, recommended 1 GB or more
* Disk Storage Space: minimum 1 GB, recommended 5 GB or more

==== Kobee Server

* RAM: minimum 512 MB, recommended 1 GB or more
* Disk Storage Space: minimum 10 GB, recommended 40 GB or more

There is no hard and fast rule for disk storage space.
The actual amount you will require depends on the number and size of projects managed with Kobee, and the size of the build results stored in the build archive.
The more projects and build results, and the larger they are, the more disk storage you will require.

==== Kobee Agent

* RAM: minimum 512 MB, recommended 1 GB or more
* Disk Storage Space: minimum 1 GB

The amount of RAM and disk space needed by a machine that runs an ALM Agent greatly depends on the amount of resources needed by the build and deploy scripts and custom phases used by the projects that are being built and deployed on it.

==== Kobee Commandline

* RAM: minimum 256 MB, recommended 256 MB
* Disk Storage Space: minimum 100 MB
