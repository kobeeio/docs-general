= Command Line Interface (Optional) 
(((Command Line Interface))) 

Kobee can be extended with an optional Command Line interface, allowing the creation of Level Requests and Packages and the generation of Reports by means of a shell interface instead of the IKAN ALM Web Application.

Possible uses:

* Manual creation of Level Requests (CLR Command): <<CommandLine.adoc#_pcommandline_clr_optionsparameters,Creating Level Requests by Specifying Options and Parameters>>
* Manual creation of Packages (Package Command): <<CommandLine.adoc#_pcommandline_pack_optionsparameters,Creating Packages by Specifying Options and Parameters>>
* Manual generation of Reports (Report Command): <<CommandLine.adoc#_pcommandline_report_optionsparameters,Generating Reports by Specifying Options and Parameters>>
* Creation of Level Requests in an external IDE. This guide describes the integration procedure for <<CommandLine.adoc#_pintegrateikanalminvscode,Visual Studio Code>> and <<CommandLine.adoc#_pintegrateikanalmineclipse,Eclipse>>.
* Automated creation of Level Requests using a Scripting Tool. A scripting tool is used to define the triggers (e.g., server backup) for Level Request creation. This guide describes the use of an <<CommandLine.adoc#_sautomatecreatinglevelrequestswithant,ANT script>>.


The Kobee Command Line interface can be installed on each client machine requiring its functionality.
It requires a connection (TCP/IP) to the central Kobee Server.
The connection with the Kobee Server is established using XML-RPC.

The CLR and Package commands can also be executed through the Kobee REST API. Consult the IKAN ALM REST API documentation for more information.

It is possible to save frequently used settings in a Properties file, so that you do not have to enter the complete Report generation parameters.
After a standard installation, one such properties file, called _report.properties_ is available in the Command Line installation folder.

Open the file in a text editor to display its content:


image::CommandLine-ReportPropertiesfile.jpg[,497,393] 

You can edit this standard file so that the settings match your requirements.
Refer to the section <<CommandLine.adoc#_pcommandline_clr_optionsparameters,Creating Level Requests by Specifying Options and Parameters>> for a description of the options and parameters.
You can also create any number of specific properties files by copying the standard file, editing the copies and saving them under logical names for later usage

. Prepare the Report generation.
+
On a Windows platform:

* Open a Command prompt.
* Browse to the Kobee Command Line working folder. After a standard installation, this is: _C:\alm\commandline_
+
You may add this location to the PATH Environment variable, so that it becomes accessible through other working directories.

+
On a Unix platform:

* Open a terminal console.
* Browse to the Kobee Command Line working directory. After a standard installation, this is: _/opt/ikan/alm/commandline_
+
You may create a symbolic link to the `alm.sh` script so that it becomes accessible through other working directories.

. Make sure that the properties file to be used is available and that the settings match the requirements.
+
If not, create the properties file and/or edit the settings with a text editor.

. Generate the Report by entering a command in the following format:
+
__alm report -propertyfile:[$PROPERTYFILENAME]
[-options] [-parameters]__
+
The following elements are available:
+

[cols="1,3,1", frame="topbot", options="header"]
|===
| Element
| Description

== Automating the Creation of Level Requests Using an ANT script

This section provides a sample ANT script that

* Creates an Level Request using the Command Line interface
* Reports the status of this action


If you want to use this ANT Script yourself, customize it by:

* Adapting the values for the Kobee Command Line options (values for serverhost, user, password, etc.)
* Saving it as _build.xml_ in the Kobee_COMMANDLINE root directory
* Launching it via the standard ANT command.

*Sample script:*

image::CommandLine-SampleANTScript.jpg[,450,406] 

*Output on success:*
