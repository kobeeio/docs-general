All Machines hosting Build and/or Deploy Environments that are used by IKAN ALM Projects, must be defined in IKAN ALM.
This is the task of the IKAN ALM Global Administrator.
Other IKAN ALM Users can verify, if all Machines used for a new Project are available.
If not, they can request the IKAN ALM Global Administrator to add the Machine definitions to IKAN ALM and install an IKAN ALM Agent on it.
Build and Deploy Actions can only be handled on a Machine on which an IKAN ALM Agent is correctly installed and running.

|===
| Field
| Description

|Java Home
|The location of the Java Virtual Machine used to launch the Agent.
This should be a Java 11 JDK.

Example:
``D:/java/jdk11.0.10 ``or `/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk`.

*Note*: On Unix or Linux systems, specify the path of the real Java installation (and not to a symlink), as the installation will verify the existence of specific jars under the provided path.


|Agent Installation Location
|Enter the location where the Agent will be installed.

Example:
``/opt/ikan/alm ``or `C:/alm`.

|Agent Distribution Folder	
|Enter the location on the Agent Machine where the Agent Installation files should be copied to.
 e.g., ``/opt/ikan/agentdistro`` or `C:/ikan/alm/agent distribution`.
After a successful installation the used installation files will be stored in a current subdirectory of this location.
|Secure Server-Agent Communication
|Indicate whether or not the communication between the ALM Server and Agent is done through a secure channel.
|Agent Port	
|Enter the port the Agent will be listening on. This field is optional, when leaving empty it is defaulted to the value of the Machine definition (which is defaulted to 20020).

If you change this value, you will also have to change the _Agent Port_ property of the Machine definition.
|Server Hostname
|Enter the hostname (or IP address) of the IKAN ALM Server machine. This field is optional, when leaving empty it is defaulted to the value of the Machine definition.

The Agent will try to connect to the Server by using this name or IP address.

|Server Port	
|In this field, enter the Port number (between 0 and 65536) the Agent will try to connect to the Server. This field is optional, when leaving empty it is defaulted to the value of the Machine defintion.
The setting can be verified in the IKAN ALM Global administration: see System Settings, Panel <<GlobAdm_System.adoc#_globadm_systemsettings_localenvironment,Local Environment>> :
the value of __IKAN ALM Server__ represents the IKAN ALM Server Machine.
Go to __Global Administration > Machines > Overview__
Check the __Server Port__ property of the IKAN ALM Server Machine. If no Server Port is defined on the ALM Server Machine, port __20021__ will be used.
|Agent Hostname	
|This field is Optional. Leave this field empty unless you want to override the automatically detected _hostname_ of the Agent.
For example, to use a fully qualified domain name like _almAgent.your.domain_ for communicating with the IKAN ALM server. It is important that the hostname entered here matches the _DHCP Name_ of the Agent Machine definition.
|Agent IP Address
|This field is Optional. Leave this field empty unless you want to override the automatically detected _IP address_ of the Agent.
For example, to use an IP Address which differs from the internal IP address for communicating with the IKAN ALM server. It is important that the IP address entered here matches the _IP address_ of the Agent Machine definition.

|===

The following first three fields are the port numbers specific to the Karaf container hosting the IKAN ALM Agent daemon.

== Machine Parameters 
(((Machine Parameters)))  (((Machines ,Parameters)))  (((Parameters ,Machine))) 

Unlike Build and Deploy Parameters, Machine Parameters are (obviously) defined for a Machine and not for a specific Environment.
Parameters defined for a specific Machine, will automatically be available for all Environments using that Machine.
This avoids having to (re)define Build and/or Deploy Parameters for each Environment linked to the Machine. 

[NOTE]
====
If an Environment Parameter and a Machine Parameter have the same name, the Environment Parameter takes precedence.
====

Depending on the Scripting Tool linked to the environment, the defined parameters will be:

* added to the command which executes the Script (in the case of NAnt and Maven2)
* written to a specific file named _alm_ant.properties_ (in the case of Ant) or _gradle.properties_ (in the case of Gradle) which is automatic loaded with the `–propertyfile` ANT option. This property file is created on the fly in the source location of the Environment in the directory containing the Script (this may be a subdirectory of the source location of the Environment in case the location of the Script was defined using a relative path). Once the Build/Deploy process has terminated, this file is automatically deleted, unless the Debug option for the Environment linked to the Level has been activated.


The _Machine Parameters Overview_ screen lets you create, edit, delete and copy Machine Parameters and allows checking their history.
