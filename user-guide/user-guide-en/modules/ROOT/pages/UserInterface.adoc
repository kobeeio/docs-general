=== Search Panels

image::UserInterface-SearchPanel.png[,983,161] 

_Search_ panels allow specifying search criteria, which restrict the list of items displayed in the _Overview_ panel.
While defining those search criteria in comboboxes and text fields, you may use the standard * and ? wildcard characters.
The asterisk can represent 0, 1 or more characters.
The question mark can represent exactly 1 character.

By default, only the most common search criteria are displayed on the search panel.
You can display all available search criteria by clicking the _Show advanced options_ link.

Using the _Reset search_ link you can clear all search criteria and display the full list of items on the Overview.

On some of the more complex search panels, you can save the search criteria as a filter, to be able to reuse them afterwards.
If a filter already exists, you can select it from the drop-down menu.
For more info on using filters, refer to the section <<Desktop_PersonalSettings.adoc#_desktop_searchfilters,Defining Search Filters>>.

The _Reset_ button will, depending on the object you are creating, clear the fields and/or restore the initial values.

=== Overview Panels
